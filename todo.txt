# Phase 1: Add Wavefunction Viewer

[ ] Create a new script: wavefunction_viewer.py
[ ] Import system builders from existing experiments (e.g., disordered_qhe_2d.py)
[ ] Build the system and finalize geometry
[ ] Compute Hamiltonian matrix: H = syst.hamiltonian_submatrix(sparse=False)
[ ] Diagonalize Hamiltonian: eigvals, eigvecs = np.linalg.eigh(H)
[ ] Select a few eigenstates (e.g., near Fermi energy)
[ ] Plot |ψ(x, y)|² over the lattice using kwant.plotter.map()
[ ] Optionally, color-code eigenstates by spatial localization or energy
[ ] Add argparse or function inputs to select:
    - Disorder strength
    - Energy range
    - Number of eigenstates to view
[ ] Save plots to /images/eigenstates/
[ ] Add results section to README.md for wavefunction viewer
[ ] (Optional) Animate eigenstate evolution as disorder changes
